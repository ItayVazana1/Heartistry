# Heartistry - Emotional Analysis of Children's Drawings

### Created by: **Itay Vazana**

Heartistry is a project designed to uncover the emotional and psychological insights hidden within children's drawings.  
Using image processing, handcrafted feature extraction, and machine learning models, this project aims to decode how children express emotions through art.

## üîç Background & Motivation
Children often express their emotions, fears, and hopes through creative drawings.  
Understanding these expressions can offer psychologists, educators, and parents valuable insights into a child's inner world.

This project was developed as part of the final project for the course:  
**Algorithms in Multimedia and Machine Learning with Python**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Planned Workflow
1. **Image Preprocessing**  
   Noise reduction, color normalization, shape enhancement, and segmentation.

2. **Feature Extraction**  
   Extraction of visual features such as:
    - Dominant colors
    - Line styles (curved, sharp, fragmented)
    - Symmetry analysis
    - Shape detection (circles, triangles, etc.)
    - Drawing density (percentage of canvas used)

3. **Emotional Classification**  
   A custom-built machine learning classifier trained on emotional attributes derived from visual features.

4. **Report Generation**  
   Automatically generate PDF/HTML reports that include:
    - Processed image
    - Extracted features
    - Emotional insights and interpretations

## üß∞ Technologies
- **Python 3.8** (project requirement)
- **OpenCV** for image processing
- **Pillow** for image handling
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- **scikit-learn** for machine learning
- **Matplotlib** for visualizations
- **ReportLab** for PDF generation
- **Jinja2** for HTML report templates

## üåç Future Use Cases
- **Psychological Assessments**: Supporting psychologists and counselors in analyzing children's emotional states.
- **Educational Insights**: Offering teachers and parents tools to better understand children's non-verbal emotional expressions.
- **Early Emotional Detection**: Identifying signs of stress, trauma, or emotional distress through creative expression.
