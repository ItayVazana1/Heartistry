## üåü Heartistry - Where Emotions Meet Creativity

Heartistry is a project designed to uncover the emotional and psychological insights hidden within children's drawings.  
Using image processing, handcrafted feature extraction, and machine learning models, this project aims to decode how children express emotions through art.

### "Art is the most intense mode of individualism that the world has known." ‚Äì Oscar Wilde

## üîç Background & Motivation

Children often express their emotions, fears, and hopes through creative drawings.  
Understanding these expressions can offer psychologists, educators, and parents valuable insights into a child's inner world.

This project was developed as part of the final project for the course **Algorithms in Multimedia and Machine Learning with Python**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Planned Workflow

### 1. **Image Preprocessing**
- Noise reduction
- Color normalization
- Shape enhancement
- Segmentation (detecting objects in the image)

### 2. **Feature Extraction**
Extraction of visual features such as:
- **Dominant colors**: Analyzing the main colors used in the drawing.
- **Line styles**: Detection of curved, sharp, or fragmented lines.
- **Symmetry analysis**: Evaluating the symmetry of the drawing.
- **Shape detection**: Recognizing basic shapes (circles, squares, triangles).
- **Drawing density**: Percentage of canvas used.

### 3. **Emotional Classification**
A custom-built machine learning classifier trained on emotional attributes derived from visual features.

### 4. **Report Generation**
Automatically generate PDF/HTML reports that include:
- Processed image
- Extracted features
- Emotional insights and interpretations

## üåç Future Use Cases

- **Psychological Assessments**: Supporting psychologists and counselors in analyzing children's emotional states.
- **Educational Insights**: Offering teachers and parents tools to better understand children's non-verbal emotional expressions.
- **Early Emotional Detection**: Identifying signs of stress, trauma, or emotional distress through creative expression.
